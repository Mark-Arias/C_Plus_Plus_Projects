// Assignment 3 # 6
// The primary distinction between classes and structures is that class methods are private by default, whereas a structure's methods are
// public by defualt. This distinction is a legacy of c and c++. The difference goes to the heart of OOP. The private nature of class design lends itself
// to data hiding and encapsulation which are central to object and class design. Aside from this distinction, structs and classes are otherwise fundamentally
// similar.
